<h1>The Three Best Movies</h1>
<h2>According to Hoang Tran</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Samurai">Seven Samurai</a></h3>
<h4>Directed by Akira Kurosawa</h4>
<p>One of the grandfathers of action films. A truly inentive and innovative showcase of cinema</p>
<h3>2. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)">The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</a></h3>
<h4>Directed by Peter Jackson</h4>
<p>While this is technically three films, I consider them to be one entire masterpeice.</p>
<h3>3. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Passion_of_Joan_of_Arc">La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc</a></h3>
<h4>Directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer</h4>
<p>A brilliant silent film enhanced by its incredible cinematography and acting.</p>
